# Demonstration Workflows

For advanced usage and batch processing, see the example workflows in the `/fpocketR/demo` folder:

- [Batch submission using Bash scripts](demos/demo_bash.md)
- [Batch submission using Snakemake](demos/demo_snakemake.md)
- [Multistate analysis on modeled RNA structures](demos/demo_modeled_rna.md)

Each demo includes step-by-step instructions and sample files to help you automate fpocketR analyses for large datasets or complex workflows.
